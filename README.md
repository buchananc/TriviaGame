# TriviaGame
This repository was created for UNCC's Coding Bootcamp homework assignment #4 with a goal of creating a fun and interactive web-based game. This time, the app must dynamically update the HTML with the jQuery library.

## Getting Started
The player will have approximately 1 minute to answer 11 multiple choice questions.  The game ends when the time runs out or when the player clicks submit.  Afterwards, a page will reveal the number of questions that player answered correctly or incorrectly.
